# Computer Hangman

This is a command-line application that runs a javascript program in the Node.js environment. It is a remake of the classic game "Hangman", with a computer-based theme!

You can clone this repository via command line (if you have Git installed) by typing:  

`git clone https://github.com/jbpkp07/ConstructorWordGuess`

If you already have Node.js installed, open your terminal, and browse to where you have cloned this Git repository and type:  

`node index.js`

If there are Node module dependencies that you are missing, please type `npm install` and it will reference the package.json file in this repository to automatically resolve those missing dependencies.

The main entry point for the application is `index.js`, and the other auxillary files are used to provide Node modules that the game depends on.

**Technologies used:**  Node, Javascript, NPM, terminal-kit, inquirer

There is also strict validation for the commands entered, with appropriate error messages if the input is invalid.

I am the sole developer of this application.
